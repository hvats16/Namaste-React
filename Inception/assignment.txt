3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
=> A CDN, or content delivery network, is a network or collection of servers in locations all over the world. Also known as a content distribution network, a CDN can refer to many types of content delivery services, such as load balancing and video streaming.

8. What is async and defer? -
